# CSCI6511_Project1
Repository for search algorithms created for project 1 of CSCI 6511.

In order to test the algorithms, make sure that graph.py, aStarSearch.py, uniformCostSearch.py and p1_graph.txt are all in the same directory. Navigate to that directory from the terminal and execute the two search methods can be tested by entering the following:

python uniformCostSeach.py

python aStarSearch.py

In both cases, the shortest path, list of explored nodes, and number of nodes explored, and maximum queue size should be returned.

Additionally, the following python libraries are needed to execute the code:

pandas

math

queue
